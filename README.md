# 2016Spike

This is our code base we used for 2016.

## Prerequisites
 * [Gradle](https://gradle.org/gradle-download/)
    * [SDKMAN](http://sdkman.io/) I used this on a Unix based OS.
 * An internet connection
    * This is to get all dependencies. Once you have downloaded all dependencies you no longer need an internet connection.

```sh
#run this to get this repository
git clone git@github.com:technomancers/2016spike.git
cd 2016spike
git checkout dev/gradle
```
